# Nordark.nvim
A Dark Theme for neovim >= 0.5 based on [Atom One Dark Theme](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-ui) and [Nord Colorscheme](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes)
This colorscheme is in VERY early development, but I am working on it and feedback is appreciated

### Requirements

## Installation

`Plug 'jackm245/nordark.nvim'`

### Manual

2. Add 
`colorscheme nordark`
to your init.vim file
